# Experiment 1 LARGE: Multi-dataset training with ROUND_ROBIN sampling (NorBERT4-large)
# FULL SCANDINAVIAN MODEL (Norwegian + Danish + Swedish)
# Combines NLI + Group B (QA) + Group A (DDSC) simultaneously
# Prevents catastrophic forgetting by training on all tasks together
#
# Total training samples: ~1.6M (NO+DA+SV)
#  - NLI: 556k (Norwegian triplets)
#  - Group B QA: 100k (NO+DA+SV easy retrieval)
#  - Group A DDSC: 949k (NO+DA+SV hard retrieval)
#
# LARGE MODEL ADJUSTMENTS (64GB M2 Pro):
#  - base model: ltg/norbert4-large (1024 dim vs 640 for base)
#  - Starting with: 256 tokens (same as base model for stability)
#  - Batch size: 2 (conservative start)
#  - max_seq_length: 256 (will increase to 512/1024 once training is stable)
#  - LOWER learning rate: 5.0e-6 (prevent rapid overfitting)
#  - NO warmup (warmup_steps: 0)
#  - STRONG regularization: weight_decay=0.015, max_grad_norm=1.0
#  - Gradient checkpointing: ENABLED (saves 30-50% memory)
#
# Note: Embedding dimension (1024) is OUTPUT size, NOT input length
#       max_seq_length (256) is INPUT token limit
#       Strategy: Start small, increase seq_length incrementally after successful runs

  # Early stopping
  # Note: In multi-dataset training with eval_dataset (no custom evaluator),
  # only individual dataset losses are available by default:
  #   - eval_nli_loss (NLI dataset - 556k samples, 34.7%)
  #   - eval_group-b-qa_loss (QA dataset - 100k samples, 6.2%)
  #   - eval_group-a-ddsc_loss (DDSC dataset - 949k samples, 59.1%)
  # 
  # We added a custom AverageLossCallback that computes:
  #   - eval_avg_loss (average of all three dataset losses)
  # 
  # Previous MTEB: QA=best (0.209/0.765), NLI=medium (0.163/0.519), DDSC=worst (0.027/0.422)
  # SOTA model (jealk/TTC-L2V-supervised-2) used DDSC as final training stage
  # 
  # Decision: Track eval_avg_loss (average across all datasets) because:
  #   1. Balanced view: All tasks contribute equally to stopping decision
  #   2. Prevents premature stopping: QA (6%) won't dominate and stop early
  #   3. Quality signal: QA quality still influences the average
  #   4. ROUND_ROBIN alignment: Matches equal sampling strategy
  #   5. Avoids DDSC trap: Don't optimize solely for worst-performing task
